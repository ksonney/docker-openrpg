OpenRPG running in Docker
=========================

Introduction
------------
I've been running a D&D game for years using OpenRPG. Sadly, 
with every OS upgrade it gets more and more difficult to 
get OpenRPG running with new versions of Python. 

And then I had a revelation - Docker lets me run OpenRPG without
needing to spend hours getting the right (i.e old and cranky)
combination of python and wxPython installed and working. 

Instructions
